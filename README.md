##  IntelliDoc Engine

IntelliDoc is a smart document analysis engine designed to extract meaningful information from uploaded files using modern NLP and cloud-based infrastructure.

###  Key Features
-  OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction from images/PDFs
-  Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify names, dates, organizations, etc.
-  Document-based Question Answering (ask questions about the uploaded file)
-  AWS S3 integration for scalable document storage
-  Dockerized backend for easy deployment
-  Built with FastAPI for high-performance asynchronous APIs
>  This project reflects my interest in backend systems, cloud engineering, and practical NLP applications. It's designed for scale and real-world use cases in legal, academic, and enterprise document automation.
